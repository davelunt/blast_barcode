# Using blast for ID of barcode DNA sequences

This repository is used by Dr Dave Lunt, University of Hull, UK to teach second year undergraduate students some basic uses of blast in a 3 hour practical class.

It includes a Jupyter notebook that helps the student learning. It will therefore require a unix kernel for the notebook. Data files needed for the exercises are included, some of those may be large.
