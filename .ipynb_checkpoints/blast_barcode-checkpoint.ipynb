For this reason various tools have been created that allow users to search within large files from the command line, and are highly optimised for their function. One of the most useful utilities for searching within a file is `grep` (global regular expression parser).\n",

    "```\n",
    "$ cd ~/intro_unix_and_blast/data/my_sequences/\n",
