A fasta file may contain one or many separate sequence records, each in fasta format. You will need to use this format several times during today’s session. Both DNA and amino acid sequences can be formatted this way. Essentially it is a greater than symbol “>” followed by any title you want to give it, then, starting on the next line, the sequence.\n",
